It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

  progress thread failed

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or

here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

  progress thread failed

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

  progress thread failed

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
PMIX developer):

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

It looks like pmix_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during pmix_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'g23n11', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'g23n09', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'g23n17', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'g24n02', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'g23n13', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:
